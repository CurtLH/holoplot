The user guide provides a detailed introduction to the API and
features of HoloPlot. In the `Introduction <Introduction.html>`_ you

you will learn how to use it to `display and save plots

from a script.

Once the basics are covered you can learn how to use the plotting API
with `tabular data <Plotting_API.html>`_, `streaming data
